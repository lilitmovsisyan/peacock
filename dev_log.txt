THINGS ACHIEVED:

1. Reminded that when giving a relative filepath/img src you need to start with '/'.

2. Starting to create a tagslist.html page (and then a page listing posts in each tag),
but having difficulty navigating the DB/model. Gonna look at this fresh tomorrow.

THINGS ACHIEVED:

1. Fixed index's images so that they hyperlink to project page.

2. Changed template inheritance to include image/carousel code
(this must be 'imported' into child templates with {{ block.super }}
so that is ends up in the right place). 

    - See Django docs for best practice and how to make custom templates
3. Added a button to return to home.html from any page without using the tabs
(since users don't always look for a tab when they want to go to base site) 
    - turned peacock jumbotron heading into button

THINGS ACHIEVED:

1. Played around with Bootstrap nav-tabs

*****************************************************************

25/01/2019
THINGS ACHIEVED:

1. Learned how to import static CSS stylesheet into templates,
including a Google Font Family, and reviewed CSS syntax.
    i. create a namespaced static folder to store style.css
    ii. At top of html template:
        {% load static %}
    iii. In html template, after loading Bootstrap stylesheets
    (and after importing any Google Fonts):
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'blog/style.css' %}">

2. Practiced using Bootstrap Card-Columns to organise titles
instead of hardcoding rows/columns on the index page.
Includes an image 
BUT 
could not make the image into a link in the usual way.  --> RESOLVED 28/01/2019 by using <a><img></a>

3. Learned about Django template filters e.g.:
    {% if entry.images.all|length == 1 %} ... {% endif%}
and Django alias assigning using:
    {% with entry.images.all.first as image %} ... {% endwith%}
and Django comment block:
    {% comment %} ... {% endcomment%}
    or single-line {# comment #} which won't be rendered

*****************************************************************
19/01/2019
THINGS ACHIEVED:

1. Two home page styles initiated: 
    a. 10 most recent entries, one after the other as you scroll down page.
    b. grid layout, meaning you have to click on an entry to see the content.

2. Entry titles on home pages link to project page.
Currently, a project page has same layout as the individual entries shown on home page. 

3. Models for entries, tags, images, create relational databases. 
Views retrieve info from databases to pass to templates.

4. Removed hardcoded url with Django {% url %} tag and values passed to view.

************************************************************************************************************************
THINGS TO DO:

1. make tags interactive: add an <a> to tags linking
to a page showing a list of other posts with matching tags
-->> Q: how to get the DB tables to show the linked tables together? (REVISE SQL)

2. figure out how to remove spaces and special characters from urls 

    e.g.
    def streamline(string):
        return "".join(i for i in string if i.isalnum()).lower()

3. create a non-administrator user 
3b. and update blog through their interface

4. Add an option to upload image WITHIN the New Entry interface

-----------------------
COMPLETED:

*******
had this weird thing with images - specifically the peacock_crotchet.jpg
It keeps saving as something with random letters at the end of the name before the .jpg
How to stop this, and why is it happening anyway? Why doesn't it link properly?
Also, atm i have to enter Images separately from the Entry. Need to change model? 
*******                                                             --> MORE OR LESS RESOLVED?? 
                ISSUE HAS GONE WHEN I LAST RE-UPLOADED IMAGE, BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON...

1. make the index page's grid layout look nicer                     --> Tried this out 25/01/2019 
1b. and add main image to it                                        --> Tried this out 25/01/2019
1c. (figure out how to make changes via css)                        --> Tried this out 25/01/2019

2. Add a navigation bar?                                            --> Tried this out 26/01/2018

3. Figure out how to use an image as a link inside a Card-Column.   --> RESOLVED 28/01/2019 by using <a><img></a>

4. Add a 'back to home' button on individual project pages.         --> RESOLVED 28/01/2019 by making 'peacock' link to home
