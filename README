PEACOCK blog/portfolio is my first attempt at using Django.
Through this project, I am practising creating a website with a relational database.
The aim is to create a website that can display my sister's various art projects and that is easy for her to update (without using code).
To do this, I am modelling this website on a blog, and have used various resources including Django Girls' blog tutorial (https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/).
Having fun learning about all the features Django provides to help automate/softcode various parts of creating a web app!
