THINGS ACHIEVED:

1. Two home page styles initiated: 
    a. 10 most recent entries, one after the other as you scroll down page.
    b. grid layout, meaning you have to click on an entry to see the content.

2. Entry titles on home pages link to project page.
Currently, a project page has same layout as the individual entries shown on home page. 

3. Models for entries, tags, images, create relational databases. 
Views retrieve info from databases to pass to templates.

4. Removed hardcoded url.


THINGS TO DO:

1. make the index page's grid layout look nicer
1b. and add main image to it
1c. (figure out how to make changes via css)

2. make tags interactive: add an <a> to tags linking
to a page showing a list of other posts with matching tags

3. figure out how to remove spaces and special characters from urls 

e.g.
def streamline(string):
    return "".join(i for i in string if i.isalnum()).lower()

4. create a non-administrator user 
4b. and update blog through their interface
